How to read the keyboard diagrams
=================================

Each key is three characters wide (unless padded with box-drawing characters).
The first character is the AltGr character, the second is the main character and
the third is the Shift character. (Not all keys have AltGr characters; in that
case the first character is a space.) Letters implicitly have their uppercase
counterpart as the Shift character.

The following keys have special meaning:

- ␣:   Space
- bs:  Backspace
- cmp: Compose
- del: Delete
- ent: Enter
- esc: Escape
- ins: Insert
- men: Menu/Apps/Context
- prt: Print Screen
- tab: Tab
- alt: Alt
- agr: AltGr
- ctl: Control
- sft: Shift
- sup: Super
- cl: Caps Lock
- ql: QWERTY Lock
- nl: Num Lock
- f1–f13: F1–F13
- ←: Left Arrow
- →: Right Arrow
- ↑: Up Arrow
- ↓: Down Arrow
- ↞: Home
- ↠: End
- ↟: Page Up
- ↡: Page Down

Note: The AltGr keys in the TECK layout aren’t actually AltGr keys; they’re the
special fn layer key of the TECK. The “fn” key in the laptop layout is a special
laptop fn key, though. To make things really confusing, the f\* key is actually
an AltGr key.

Also note that this compact notation is not able to truly represent some updates
I made to the layout:

- The Insert key is actually in the AltGr layer since I don’t use it very
  often and sometimes hit it by mistake. (This key is empty in the main layer.)
- The ”“ and ’‘ keys have F6 and F12 in the AltGr layer, respectively. Those are
  the F keys I use the most. (I used to have an F layer, but sadly I couldn’t
  get it to work in Ubuntu 17.10. Similarly, I used to have a mouse keys layer,
  and had to scrap that as well, but luckily I never used it.)
