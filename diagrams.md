How to read the keyboard diagrams
=================================

Each key is three characters wide (unless padded with box-drawing characters).
The first character is the AltGr character, the second is the main character and
the third is the Shift character. (Not all keys have AltGr characters; in that
case the first character is a space.) Letters implicitly have their uppercase
counterpart as the Shift character.

The following keys have special meaning:

- ␣:   Space
- bs:  Backspace
- cmp: Compose
- del: Delete
- ent: Enter
- esc: Escape
- ins: Insert
- men: Menu/Apps/Context
- prt: Print Screen
- tab: Tab
- alt: Alt
- agr: AltGr
- ctl: Control
- sft: Shift
- sup: Super
- cl: Caps Lock
- ml: Mouse Lock
- ql: QWERTY Lock
- nl: Num Lock
- f1–f14: F1–F14
- ←: Left Arrow
- →: Right Arrow
- ↑: Up Arrow
- ↓: Down Arrow
- ↞: Home
- ↠: End
- ↟: Page Up
- ↡: Page Down
- ↖ ↑ ↗ ← → ↙ ↓ ↘: Move the mouse pointer in the indicated direction.
- ×·· ·×· ··×: Select left, middle or right mouse button, respectively.
- ➀: Click using the selected mouse button.
- ➁: Double-click using the selected mouse button.
- ❶: Right-click.
- ↧: Hold selected mouse button.
- ↥: Release selected mouse button.

The f\* key should be held to activate the f\* layer.

The ◰ ◳ ◲ keys are unused.

Note: The AltGr keys in the TECK layout aren’t actually AltGr keys; they’re the
special fn layer key of the TECK. The “fn” key in the laptop layout is a special
laptop fn key, though. To make things really confusing, the f\* key is actually
an AltGr key.
